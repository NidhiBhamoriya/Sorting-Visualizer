# Sorting Visualizer


### Sorting Visualizer is a web application,  It provides an interactive way to visualize classic sorting algorithms.

-> I built this Sorting Visualizer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on responsiveness for both desktop and mobile devices.

-> I developed this project to visually demonstrate the working of three sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.



## Aim: 
#### -> This project serves as an educational tool to make learning algorithms more intuitive and engaging.



## Key Features:

### 1) Customizable Sorting Speed: 
-> Includes a slider that allows users to adjust the sorting speed as desired.

### 2) Dynamic Step-by-Step Messages: 
-> Displays concise, engaging messages during guide users through the sorting process, explaining each step clearly.

### 3) Responsive Design: 
-> Optimized for devices of all sizes, providing a seamless experience across screens.

### 4) Sorting Algorithms:
-> Bubble Sort: Visualizes comparisons and swaps in real-time with smooth transitions.

-> Selection Sort: Highlights the maximum element and its correct placement in each iteration.

-> Insertion Sort: Shows the insertion process step-by-step as elements are placed in their sorted position.
